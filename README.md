# CA_RiparianGDE
The scripts in this rep show how I used Google Earth Engine and R to evaluate groundwater reliance of riparian vegetation across California from 2015 to 2019.  The following instructions show a step-by-step process.  This repo is accompanied by the paper, "Seasonal and Regional variation in riparian vegetation reliance on groundwater detected using Sentinel-2 across California" by M.M. Rohde, J. Stella, M.B. Singer, and D. Roberts (currently in preparation).

## Introduction
 Until recently, technological limitations have hindered the assessment of groundwater influences on riparian ecosystem health at the spatial and temporal scales relevant to policy and management.  Here, we synthesize large, publicly-available datasets of mapped riparian vegetation communities, groundwater levels, and stream flow regimes to assess the influence of groundwater on riparian vegetation across California (USA).  We used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to assess riparian vegetation health via NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) at 10-m spatial resolution - a scale required to characterize the narrow, highly fragmented riparian woodlands.  We link riparian NDVI responses to available field-based groundwater level data for riparian vegetation.
